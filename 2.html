          <p>Join us at this meeting in Conway Hall where we discuss the most crucial issue of our times - climate change and how or if we can address it.

In September there were massive world wide protests over climate change as school children left school and often with their parents protested that their Governments are not doing enough to tackle the most serious problem facing us today.

At this meeting we will have four speakers that will address how we can tackle climate change or whether we have left it too late.

Charles Appleby will argue that we can all make a difference to climate change by individual and community action.

Camilla Berens will argue that climate change can be addressed by developing alternative technologies to the ones we have at present and based on fossil fuels.

Elaine Graham-Leigh an author and campaigner will argue that existing dogmas about overconsumption and personal responsibility need challenging as in order to tackle climate change then what we need is system change.

Jasper Tomlinson Will argue that the climate crisis has reached a point when only climate fixing or as it was called geo engineering will be sufficient to make a difference.

There will be plenty of time for discussion and debate where we can add our views as well as ask important questions.

This meeting is free for students, GlobalNet21 and Conway Hall Ethical Society Members. There is a Â£5 charge for all others.</p>
