          <p>We believe that it is NOT too late to make an impact on climate change. Join us for a viewing of the hugely powerful film Tomorrow that is guaranteed to inspire you to take action. Afterwards, we will have Stephanie Tudgey, (Sustainable Steph) www.sustainablestephanie.com talk about the projects that have inspired her and the many ways that we can all become empowered to participate in helping save the destruction of our environment.

The film Tomorrow is hugely positive, affirming and inspirational, exploring creative solutions in the fields of food, energy, transport, economics and education. It visits permaculture farms, urban agriculture projects, community-owned renewable projects, local currencies, creative schools, ambitious recycling projects. It has been a huge boost to community-led projects, and is currently on release in 29 other countries, regularly receiving standing ovations, and leading to the formation of many new community projects. It is the perfect antidote to the current sense of global despondency. It also has a great soundtrack.

Already viewed by over 1.5 million people in France alone, and winner of Best Documentary at the Cesar Awards (the French Oscars), ‘Tomorrow’ has been hugely impactful. Produced by activist and writer Cyril Dion and actress/director Mélanie Laurent, it tells the story of their search for solutions to the crisis humanity faces.
